              <h2>About FoodRecipeApp</h2>
              <p>FoodRecipeApp is a full-stack web application that I developed as my first solo project. It aims to provide a platform where users can explore, create, and share their favorite food recipes. The application is built using React, Node.js, and a PostgreSQL database.</p>
              
              <h3>Work in Progress</h3>
              <p>FoodRecipeApp is still a work in progress, and I am continuously adding new features and improving its functionality. One of the main challenges I am currently facing is implementing a search functionality to help users easily find specific recipes based on ingredients or categories. I want to ensure that the application offers a smooth and intuitive user experience.</p>
              
              <h3>Planning using Trello Boards</h3>
              <p>To keep track of tasks, prioritize features, and manage the development process effectively, I use Trello boards. Trello helps me visualize the project's roadmap, create task cards, and track progress as I work on different features. It provides a clear overview of the project and helps me stay organized.</p>
              
              <h3>Challenges</h3>
              <p>Developing FoodRecipeApp as a solo project has posed its own set of challenges. One of the main challenges is designing an appealing and user-friendly interface that encourages users to explore and contribute to the community. Additionally, I've been working on improving the backend functionality to handle a growing number of users and recipes efficiently.</p>
              
              <h3>Reflections</h3>
              <p>Working on FoodRecipeApp has been an invaluable learning experience. It has allowed me to apply the knowledge and skills I gained during my time at Dev Academy and put them into practice. Developing a full-stack web application on my own has taught me the importance of self-motivation, problem-solving, and effective time management. It has also highlighted the significance of continuous learning and staying up-to-date with the latest web development technologies.</p>
