        <h2>About RecipeBlog</h2>
        <p>RecipeBlog is a full-stack web application that I developed as my first solo project. It aims to provide a platform where users can create and share their own unique recipes. The application is built using React, Node.js, and a PostgreSQL database.</p>
    <h3>Work in Progress</h3>
    <p>RecipeBlog is still a work in progress, and I am continuously adding new features and improving its functionality. One of the main challenges I am currently facing is implementing client-side rendering with React. I want to ensure that the user interface is responsive and delivers a seamless experience to the users.</p>
    
    <h3>Planning using Trello Boards</h3>
    <p>To keep track of tasks, prioritize features, and manage the development process effectively, I use Trello boards. Trello helps me visualize the project's roadmap, create task cards, and track progress as I work on different features. It provides a clear overview of the project and helps me stay organized.</p>
    
    <h3>Challenges</h3>
    <p>Developing RecipeBlog as a solo project has posed its own set of challenges. One of the main challenges is handling the entire development process by myself, from designing the user interface to implementing backend functionality. It requires me to take everything I have learned at Dev Academy and apply it to create a functional and user-friendly application.</p>
    
    <h3>Reflections</h3>
    <p>Working on RecipeBlog has been an invaluable learning experience. It has allowed me to apply the knowledge and skills I gained during my time at Dev Academy and put them into practice. Developing a full-stack web application on my own has taught me the importance of self-motivation, problem-solving, and effective time management. It has also highlighted the significance of continuous learning and staying up-to-date with the latest web development technologies.</p>
