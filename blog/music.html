      <h1>!music</h1>
      <p>

        !music was a group project developed during my time at Dev Academy, and it was one of the many ideas brainstormed during our Friday group project. I suggested the idea of a music app that would allow users to discover new music and share their favorite tracks with friends, and we decided to pursue it. As the back-end/front-end developer, I worked closely with my team to bring this app to life.
        
        Reflecting on the project, there were certainly areas that could be improved. One of the main challenges we faced was integrating external APIs into our app, which caused some delays and setbacks. However, we were able to overcome these obstacles through perseverance and collaboration.
        
        From this project, I learned the importance of effective communication and collaboration within a team, especially when working on a complex project. I also developed my skills in cutting-edge technologies such as Typescript, React, Redux, SQLite, Superagent, Jest, and CSS, as well as in designing logos and styles for the app.
        
        Overall, !music was a great learning experience for me, and I am grateful for the opportunity to have worked on it with such a talented and dedicated team.

      <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <p>Working on a compressed timeline of just two days was a significant challenge for our team. We had to ensure that we were able to deliver a high-quality product within the given time frame while also coordinating closely with our front-end developer to ensure that our code integrated seamlessly with theirs. Additionally, the scope of the project was ambitious, and we had to work collaboratively to ensure that we could deliver on all of the project's features while still meeting the deadline.</p>
      <o>Unfortunately, the code base for !music was edited for personal use and is no longer available for public viewing. However, I did create a similar version of the app for one of my personal projects called Project-X, which is still in development. Through working on both projects, I have gained valuable experience in web development and learned how to improve my coding practices. In retrospect, I believe that there is always room for improvement in any project, and if I were to work on !music again, I would focus on improving the user interface and adding more features to enhance the user experience.</o>
