      <h2>About Waitless</h2>
      <p>Waitless is a web application designed by a team of developers as a final group project for a web development course. The application was created to streamline the process of ordering food at a Thai restaurant. It allows customers to place their orders ahead of time, avoid waiting in long lines, and make payments securely.</p>
      
      <h3>Overview of Project</h3>
      <p>The Waitless application was built using TypeScript, React, Node.js, and SQLite3. The app has a simple and intuitive user interface that guides customers through the ordering process. The front-end development team focused on creating a responsive design that looks great on both desktop and mobile devices. The back-end team worked on implementing the payment gateway and database integration.</p>
      
      <h3>Role during the Project</h3>
      <p>As the front-end developer, my role was to ensure that the user interface is user-friendly, visually appealing, and functional. I worked closely with the back-end team to integrate the payment gateway and ensure that payment processing was secure. Additionally, I was responsible for testing the application to ensure that it functions reliably and meets the needs of our target audience.</p>
      
      <h3>Stretch Goals</h3>
      <p>During the development process, we identified several stretch goals that would further enhance the app's functionality and user experience. These include:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Implementing a loyalty program that rewards customers for frequent orders.</li>
      <li>Integrating the app with popular food delivery platforms such as Uber Eats, Grubhub, and DoorDash.</li>
      <li>Adding support for multiple languages to make the app accessible to customers who speak different languages.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Planning using Excel Draw</h3>
      <p>We used Excel Draw to plan the application's user interface and design. This allowed us to create wireframes and mockups that helped us visualize the app's layout and design. We also used Excel Draw to plan our development approach and create a roadmap that helped us stay on track and ensure timely delivery of features.</p>
      
      <h3>Challenges</h3>
      <p>During the development process, we faced several challenges that tested our problem-solving skills and ability to collaborate as a team. These included:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>The need for multiple days of replanning as we refined the app's functionality and adjusted our development approach to better meet our goals.</li>
      <li>The challenge of integrating the payment gateway and ensuring that payment processing was secure and reliable.</li>
      <li>The need to optimize the app's performance and ensure that it runs smoothly on a variety of devices.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Reflections</h3>
      <p>Working on Waitless was an excellent learning experience that allowed me to improve my skills as a developer and collaborate effectively with a team. I learned the importance of effective planning and communication in ensuring the timely delivery of a high-quality product. I also gained valuable experience working with TypeScript, React, Node.js, and SQLite3, which are widely used in web development.</p>
